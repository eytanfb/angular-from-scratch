#Angular from scratch

This is my copy of the code I wrote following Matthieu Lux's talk at ng-europe 2014. The details are below.

Below this line is from Matthieu Lux:
--------------------------------------------

This is the repository of my live coding from [ng-europe](http://ngeurope.org) and [Soft Shake](http://soft-shake.ch).

It's a fork of the initiative of a Workshop for the [DevoxxFR](http://www.devoxx.fr/) and the [Mix-IT](http://www.mix-it.fr/). You can find more description on the original repository.

This talk has been inspired by some blog posts on the internet and especially [Make Your Own AngularJS, Part 1: Scopes And Digest](http://teropa.info/blog/2013/11/03/make-your-own-angular-part-1-scopes-and-digest.html). The blogger [@teropa](https://twitter.com/teropa) started the adaptation of the concept on an eBook which can only recommend [Build Your Own AngularJS](http://teropa.info/build-your-own-angular).
